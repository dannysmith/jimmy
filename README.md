Jimmy is a todo list. That's all.

## Why Does Jimmy Exist?

Mainly, Jimmy is intended as an example app, for use when Danny is teaching. It also serves as a playground for testing new tools, best practices and ideas. One day, it might be good enough to use on a daily basis, for managing todos. That day is a long way off.
